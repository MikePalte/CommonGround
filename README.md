# CommonGround
Common Ground is a Kotlin application that aims to help seperated parents with their conflicting schedules.
Our goal is to allow for seperated parents to view each others schedule along with their kids schedule, to allow 
for better coordination between them. We hope that through the use of our app parents will be able to better schedule
who will have their kid on what days and be able to see upcoming events that both parents may what to attend such as a 
sporting event for a team their child is apart of.
